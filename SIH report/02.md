### 1. **Registration & Login Flow:**

   - **User Registration:**
     - Each department (e.g., road construction, water supply, electricity) will need to create an account.
     - The registration form should collect details like department name, department head's contact information, and the type of work they do.
     - Individual employees (officers, technical experts) can also create accounts under their respective departments.
     - Users will have different roles:
       - **Admin** (department head): can manage projects, tasks, and resources.
       - **Employee/Officer**: can view assigned tasks, participate in discussions.
       - **Technical Expert**: can provide technical support and collaborate on tasks.
     - Once registered, the admin should approve employees' accounts to verify that they belong to the department.
   
   - **Login:**
     - Users log in with their email and password.
     - The platform should support role-based access control (admins will see more options than regular employees).
   
### 2. **Dashboard Flow:**

   - **Admin Dashboard:**
     - After login, department admins see an overview of their department’s projects, resources, and assigned tasks.
     - Sections include:
       - **Ongoing Projects**: A list of projects the department is currently working on.
       - **Upcoming Projects**: Projects planned but not yet started.
       - **Available Resources**: Tools, machinery, or personnel that can be shared with other departments.
       - **Assigned Tasks**: Tasks that need to be completed by the department (from inter-departmental projects).
     - Admins will also have access to features like task creation, scheduling, and meeting organization.

   - **Employee Dashboard:**
     - Employees see a simplified version of the dashboard with:
       - **Assigned Tasks**: Tasks they need to work on, deadlines, and reports they need to submit.
       - **Upcoming Workshops/Trainings**: Any workshops, seminars, or training sessions they are required to attend.
       - **Discussion Forum Notifications**: Notifications from forums where they’ve participated.
   
### 3. **Data Sharing Flow:**

   - **Project Data Upload:**
     - Each department needs to upload data about their ongoing and upcoming projects.
     - The system will collect:
       - **Project Name**: e.g., "Gas Pipeline Installation in Zone X."
       - **Location**: The area where the project will take place, ideally marked on a city map.
       - **Start Date/End Date**: Timeline for the project.
       - **Resources Used**: Machines, tools, or experts involved.
     - Once uploaded, the project will be visible to other departments so they can see if there are overlapping worksites or shared resources.
   
   - **Resource Sharing:**
     - Departments can list available machinery, technology, or expertise that they can share with others.
     - Example: The water supply department might have a drilling machine that the road construction team needs.
     - Other departments can request access to these shared resources for their own projects.
   
### 4. **Task Management Flow:**

   - **Creating Tasks:**
     - For inter-departmental projects (projects involving multiple departments), admins create tasks.
     - Example: A project to lay down pipelines might require tasks like “Excavation” (road department) and “Pipe Installation” (water department).
     - Tasks include details such as:
       - **Assigned Department**: Who is responsible.
       - **Task Description**: What needs to be done.
       - **Due Date**: Deadline for task completion.
   
   - **Task Scheduling:**
     - Admins schedule when each department should start their part of the project.
     - The platform should visualize this in a Gantt chart or timeline, so everyone knows when their task is due and how it fits into the larger project.
   
   - **Task Reporting:**
     - Once a task is completed, departments submit reports via the platform.
     - Reports include progress, issues faced, and potential delays. This helps project managers track the status of the project.

### 5. **Project Coordination Flow:**

   - **Site Identification:**
     - The platform uses location data to identify when multiple departments are working on the same site.
     - Example: If the electricity department is planning work on a road where the gas department has an ongoing project, the system flags this as a potential conflict.
   
   - **Unified Phasing and Planning:**
     - Departments collaborate on phasing and planning the execution of projects on the same site.
     - For example, the gas department might schedule pipeline installation **before** the road department starts resurfacing the road.
     - The system assists in combining project phases, which helps in saving costs and minimizing disruptions.
   
   - **Meeting Organization:**
     - If departments need to discuss coordination for a project, the platform allows them to organize meetings.
     - Features include:
       - **Shared Calendar**: See when key decision-makers are available.
       - **Virtual Meetings**: Integrated video calls or shared online meeting spaces.

### 6. **Forum & Discussion Flow:**

   - **Intra-department Forum:**
     - Each department has its own private forum for internal discussions.
     - Here, employees can discuss issues, share ideas, or solve problems.
   
   - **Inter-department Forum:**
     - This is a shared space where different departments can collaborate and discuss inter-departmental projects.
     - Example: If there’s a conflict about which department should take charge of a specific task, they can discuss it here.
   
   - **Public Forum:**
     - A separate section allows for public feedback. Citizens can report problems (e.g., road damage) or provide suggestions to departments.
     - Departments can respond to public queries and provide updates about project progress.
   
### 7. **Training & Workshops Flow:**

   - **Creating Training Events:**
     - Admins can organize training sessions or workshops to improve the skills of employees.
     - These sessions could be on topics like new technologies, machinery operation, or effective collaboration techniques.
   
   - **Employee Registration for Workshops:**
     - Employees can see upcoming training programs on their dashboard and register for them.
     - Workshops can be mandatory for certain roles, and employees will be notified if they are required to attend.
   
   - **Tracking Participation:**
     - The platform should track which employees attended the workshops and provide certificates or completion reports if necessary.

### Detailed Flow Example (Scenario):
1. **Project Initiation:**
   - The road construction department logs into the platform and adds a new project for road construction in a specific city area.
   - The water department sees that they have a future project to lay water pipelines in the same area.
   - Both departments are alerted about the overlapping location.

2. **Planning Meeting:**
   - A meeting is organized between the road and water departments to plan the work phases together.
   - The water department schedules the pipeline installation before the road department starts resurfacing the road.

3. **Task Assignment:**
   - Each department assigns tasks to their employees. The road department creates a task for excavation and assigns it to their team.

4. **Task Execution:**
   - The water department completes its pipeline installation and submits a report through the platform.
   - The road department is notified and starts resurfacing the road after pipeline installation.

5. **Discussion Forum:**
   - During the project, an issue arises with the excavation. The road department opens a thread in the inter-department forum to ask for advice from the gas department (since they’ve done similar work before).

6. **Completion:**
   - Once all tasks are completed, the project status is updated, and a final report is generated.
