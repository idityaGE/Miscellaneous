Let’s go into more detail about the **features and functionalities** you need to build for the hackathon project platform, focusing on **which users** can access each functionality.

### 1. **User Registration System (for departments and personnel)**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Department Registration:**
  - Each department (e.g., road construction, water supply, gas, electricity) creates a profile on the platform.
  - **Admin-level users** (typically department heads or project managers) set up the department profile.
  - The department's profile will include basic information such as department name, contact details, and key areas of responsibility (e.g., road infrastructure, utilities, etc.).

- **Individual User Registration:**
  - Individual employees, officers, and technical experts register and are assigned to their respective departments.
  - **Roles and permissions** will vary depending on the user type:
    - **Admin:** Can manage all the data, tasks, and projects for their department.
    - **Officer/Employee:** Can view and participate in assigned tasks, projects, and discussions but cannot make high-level changes.
    - **Technical Expert:** Can provide technical input on relevant tasks and contribute to inter-departmental forums.

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Department heads and managers who oversee projects, resources, and tasks.
- **Employees/Officers:** General staff responsible for executing tasks.
- **Technical Experts:** Specialists who assist in resolving technical challenges across departments.

### 2. **Data Sharing Between Departments**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Project Information Sharing:**
  - Departments can upload and share detailed information about their ongoing and upcoming projects.
  - This includes:
    - **Project details:** Title, description, status (ongoing/upcoming), and deadlines.
    - **Project location:** A map or geolocation to mark where the project is happening.
    - **Resources involved:** Information about machines, technology, and expertise required for the project.
  - Other departments can view this data to avoid duplication and assess if they are working in overlapping areas.

- **Resource Inventory Sharing:**
  - Departments list available **resources** such as equipment, machinery, or skilled personnel that they are willing to share with other departments.
  - This can help streamline collaboration and reduce the need for multiple departments to purchase or rent the same equipment.
  - The system should allow **requests for resources** from other departments when they need them for a project.

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Upload and manage project and resource data.
- **Employees/Officers:** View project and resource data, request resources when necessary.
- **Technical Experts:** Provide consultation on shared resources and offer expertise across departments.

### 3. **Task Creation, Scheduling, and Reporting**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Task Creation:**
  - For each inter-departmental project, tasks are broken down and assigned to the relevant departments.
  - Each task includes:
    - **Task title:** A clear name (e.g., “Excavation for pipelines”).
    - **Description:** Detailed instructions for the task.
    - **Deadline:** When the task should be completed.
    - **Assigned department(s):** The responsible department or team.

- **Task Scheduling:**
  - Tasks must be scheduled in a way that avoids conflict between departments.
  - The platform will provide a **timeline** (e.g., a Gantt chart) showing when tasks should be started and completed.

- **Task Reporting:**
  - Departments report on task progress, including:
    - **Completion status**
    - **Challenges or delays**
    - **Updates:** Uploading relevant documents, photos, or status reports.
  - Admins can review these reports to ensure project phases are proceeding as planned.

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Create, assign, and schedule tasks. Review task reports and track project progress.
- **Employees/Officers:** Carry out assigned tasks, update progress, and submit reports.
- **Technical Experts:** May be involved in reviewing or contributing to technical tasks.

### 4. **Unified Project Phasing, Planning, and Execution**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Identifying Project Overlap:**
  - The system will automatically flag when multiple departments are working on the same site, enabling collaboration.
  - For example, if the gas department is planning a project in the same area where the road construction team is working, the platform will highlight this overlap.

- **Phased Execution Planning:**
  - Departments will collaborate to phase their work in a unified way. For example:
    - The gas department will install pipelines **before** the road department starts road resurfacing.
    - Departments can adjust timelines based on each other’s schedules.

- **Cost-Saving Features:**
  - By phasing the projects together, the platform helps departments save costs by avoiding rework (e.g., digging up a newly paved road).

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Will receive notifications about project overlaps and adjust schedules accordingly.
- **Employees/Officers:** Execute tasks based on the phased timeline.
- **Technical Experts:** Offer technical advice on how to optimize the phased execution.

### 5. **Organizing Meetings and Collaboration Tools**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Meeting Organization:**
  - The platform allows users to organize virtual or in-person meetings between departments when needed for project collaboration.
  - Features include:
    - **Shared calendars:** To help departments schedule meetings at convenient times.
    - **Meeting invitations:** Sending invites to relevant departments and teams.
    - **Online meetings:** Integration with video conferencing tools like Zoom or Google Meet.

- **Collaborative Tools:**
  - Shared **documents** (e.g., project plans, blueprints) can be uploaded and discussed.
  - **Meeting notes** and minutes can be recorded and saved for future reference.

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Can schedule and organize meetings, invite relevant departments.
- **Employees/Officers:** Attend meetings as necessary to discuss task execution.
- **Technical Experts:** Join meetings to provide input on technical matters.

### 6. **Training, Workshops, and Capacity Building**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Creating Workshops/Training Events:**
  - Admins can create and schedule training programs, workshops, or seminars to upskill employees.
  - Workshops may include topics like new technologies, best practices for collaboration, or specific technical skills.

- **Employee Registration:**
  - Employees can register for these events directly through the platform.

- **Tracking Participation:**
  - The platform will track which employees have completed workshops or training, helping departments monitor skill development.

#### **Users:**
- **Admins:** Create and manage workshops, assign mandatory training to employees.
- **Employees/Officers:** Register for and attend workshops.
- **Technical Experts:** May host or attend workshops, especially for training on technical subjects.

### 7. **Discussion Forum (Intra-departmental, Inter-departmental, and Public)**

#### **Functionality:**
- **Intra-department Forum:**
  - Private forums for each department to discuss internal matters such as project updates, challenges, and task assignments.
  - **Admins** moderate these discussions.

- **Inter-department Forum:**
  - Departments collaborate on shared projects, ask for advice, or discuss how to resolve project conflicts.
  - Example: The road department might ask the electricity department for advice on coordinating their tasks for a particular project.

- **Public Forum:**
  - The public can use this forum to:
    - Report issues (e.g., road damage).
    - Provide feedback or ask for updates on projects.
    - Engage with city departments directly.
  - Departments will need to respond to these inquiries and keep the public informed about project progress.

#### **Users:**
